# Debugging Machine Learning Pipelines

The paper focuses on addressing the challenge of identifying root causes for failures in machine learning pipeline instances. Failures are defined as instances where the output model accuracy is unsatisfactory.

**Definitions:**

- **Machine Learning Pipeline (Templates):** Code structures capable of training a model when combined with specific hyperparameters.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline Instances:** Configurations resulting from specific choices of hyperparameters for running a machine learning pipeline.
- **Failures:** Instances where the model accuracy output is unsatisfactory.

**Methodology:**

The approach involves identifying root causes of failures from existing runs and confirming these root causes through additional runs if necessary. Decision trees are employed to identify possible root causes, and an algebraic algorithm is then used to refine and narrow down the most likely root cause.

**Evaluation:**

The authors utilized a Kaggle competition pipeline, generating random hyperparameter choices. Ground truth data for root causes was manually inspected. MLDebugger and related tools were then employed to automatically identify root causes. The effectiveness of the approach is questioned, with an indication that it may not be entirely successful.

**Impressions:**

The paper's methodology is viewed as potentially valuable, but there is an implicit concern regarding feature extraction. The author does not explicitly address any issues related to feature extraction, leaving a gap in understanding how effectively and robustly features can be derived from the data. The sentiment conveyed suggests that while the approach may have promise, the success of the method may heavily depend on the quality and relevance of the features extracted.
